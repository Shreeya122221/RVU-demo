# Smart Helmet Ignition Control System

This repository contains my IoT mini project developed as part of my coursework.

## Project Description
The Smart Helmet Ignition Control System ensures that a two-wheeler starts
only when the rider is wearing a helmet. It improves road safety by
preventing ignition if the helmet is not detected.

## Technologies Used
- Arduino
- ESP8266 (NodeMCU)
- IR Sensor
-  433 MHz RF Transmitter & Receiver
- Blynk IoT App
- L298N Motor Driver
- Embedded C / C++
